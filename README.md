# Backend Test Solution

I have created a single script which retrieves two sets of remote data, filters and merges said data and then sends the results on to a remote server.

## Prepare respository
1. To clone the repository type 'git clone https://github.com/jso-dev/kf_backend_test.git' in the CLI.

2. Move to the cloned directory by typing 'cd kf_backend_test' into the CLI'

3. Using the CLI run 'npm' to install all dependancies'

4. Once dependancies are installed run 'node app' to run app.js'

## To test run 'npm test'

# NOTES

I did not write any tests\
I did not add error capture for other server response codes\
I did not complete the bonus task
